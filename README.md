This lab involves using multiple components from previous labs and created new ones on top of it
to make an arithmetic and logic unit. The entire circuit begin with two 8-bit input into two latches, where
the data is temporarily stored, the data is then proceeded into an ALU unit, where a series of calculations
and outputs into two seven-segment displays. The control unit consists of 2 separate components, the
finite state machine (FSM) and a 4 to 16 decoder. The FSM is used for determine controller sequence and
the decoder decides which operation to make in the ALU. 

<p>This repository consists of all the files for Lab 6 of the course COE 328, you can use this repository freely however do not copy any code directly for it.</p>
